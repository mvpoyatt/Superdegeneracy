Any python files in this code can be run with the command
    python filename.py
where filename is the name of the file you want to compile and run. 
Several of the programs will ask for input.
P is the unitless ratio of degeneracies between two levels in the superdegenerate system. 
T is the temperature of the system in Kelvin.
No other inputs should be required. 
Other parameters of the experiments can be changed by modifying the GLOBAL
"CONSTANTS" section of the python file. These include:
temperature
number of levels
start level
oscillation frequency
probability of a particle jumping from the top to bottom level
number of particles being simulated
number of steps for which the system is run
